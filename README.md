# Pub Sub (Publish-Subscribe)

"Pub Sub" stands for Publish-Subscribe, which is a design pattern used to facilitate communication between different parts of an application.

Here's a basic explanation of how it works:

1.  **Publishers**: These are components or modules that generate events or messages.
    
2.  **Subscribers**: These are components or modules that listen for specific events or messages and react to them.
    
3.  **Broker (or Pub-Sub system)**: This is the intermediary that manages the subscriptions and distributes the messages to the appropriate subscribers.
